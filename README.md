# ThisMortalCoilDecoder

A decoder for the poem at the end of "This Mortal Coil" by Emily Suvada.

In the novel "This Mortal Coil," by Emily Suvada, the main character finds an encoded poem inside a DNA strand. By converting the base pairs into binary, the binary into integers, and the integers into characters, the message is revealed. 
The end of the book included the encoded message, along with the challenge to decode it. 

This code asks for an input file (the nucleotides), and an output destination. 
It then writes a .txt file with the decoded message. 

Note: make sure to include the file extensions (.txt) when prompted for filepaths.
